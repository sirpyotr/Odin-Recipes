          Fried rice is one my favourite quick recipes for any time of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very delicious and has a lot of variety. Its basically just eggs
          and rice with whatever you have in your fridge.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <hr />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start heating your pan on maximum heat. This dish is cooked on high
            heat so it is essential to
            <em>prepare all your ingredients</em> before you actually start
            throwing things in your pan.
          </li>
          <li>Prep Ingredients</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Finely mince Garlic and Ginger.</li>
            <li>Dice 1 small Carrot and 1 medium Onion.</li>
            <li>Lay out all your spices and sauces by the stove.</li>
            <li>Place your rice in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk Eggs in a seperate bowl or cup.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            By now your pan is most likely searing hot so pour in the oil. Don't
            be shy, the eggs will absorb a lot of the oil before you actually
            put in your rice, so you need to pour a decent ammount.
          </li>
          <li>Pour in your whisked Eggs and constantly stir with a spatula.</li>
          <li>
            When the eggs are barely cooked add in all the vegetables and stir
            constantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            After a minute or two add in the rice. We don't want to overkill the
            eggs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Break up the rice and continue stirring until some of the moisture
            is gone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Soy Sauce so that there are no white spots of rice left and
            stir.
          </li>
          <li>
            After some of the moisture from the soy sauce has evaporated add in
            your spices and stirr. By this point it's pretty much done so you
            can kill the heat when you feel that you have "fried" the rice to
            your liking.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Enjoy :)</strong></li>
        </ol>

          <em>very</em> delicious.

# odin-recipes

This is my first project on the TOP (The Odin Project) curriculum.

The Odin-Recipes project will showcase my knowledge on:
    -How to make a boilerplate-html
    -File structure
    -Basic git operations
    -Basic elements:
        -Lists
        -Links
        -Images
        -Paragraphs
        -Headings

The main goal of the project is to create a Recipe-themed website using html pages.
